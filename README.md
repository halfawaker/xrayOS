# xrayOS
A simple, terminal-based operating system* coded in C.
This is coded by one one guy, and I'm not even that good at C. Also keep in mind that this is quite early in development right now, and everything is subject to change.

Warning: the .exe file provided has not been tested! Please alert me if there are any problems. Also, keep in mind that this is TERMINAL BASED and an exe might just not work, I'll be sure to test it on a virtual machine when I have the time.

If you would like to modify xrayOS, please download the provided C source code, to compile it as a .o file run `gcc -Wall -g -c xrayOS.c` then `gcc -o xrayOS xrayOS.o` to make it an executable file.
